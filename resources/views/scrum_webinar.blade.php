                            In 2015, I graduated with a degree in Geography but the first job opportunity I had after NYSC was in Digital Marketing.
                        </h1>
                        <p class="banner-disc text-anim">
                            To cut the long story short, I only practiced as a Digital Marketing professional until around mid- 2022 when I joined my current company as a Marketing Manager and through this new job opportunity, my aspirations of working alongside highly technical teams started becoming a reality.
                        </p>
                        <p class="banner-disc text-anim">
                            Is Digital Marketing not full of opportunities?
                        </p>
                        <p class="banner-disc text-anim">
                            Of course, it is! I knew Digital Marketing is very lucrative but Scrum and Product Ownership have risen to become the new 'oil' and experts in these areas are highly sought after.
                        </p>
                        <p class="banner-disc text-anim">
                            But I had one problem..
                        </p>
                        <p class="banner-disc text-anim">I wasn't interested in coding. While I believe knowing the basics is not out of place, I knew it wasn't a thing I would love to do in the long term.</p>
                        <p class="banner-disc text-anim">Thankfully, I met my mentor in this company and he introduced me to this profitable IT field (Scrum) I never knew existed.</p>
                        <p class="banner-disc text-anim">For me, the distinctive approach of Scrum to actualizing both IT-related and non IT-related projects caught my attention.</p>
                        <p class="banner-disc text-anim">Not only that, with many limitations that come with planning, executing and managing a project, Scrum has proven to be the most appropriate project management framework adopted by more than 70% tech startups and top IT firms in the world.</p>
                        <p class="banner-disc text-anim">So, why wouldn't I embrace this rare privilege?</p>
                        <p class="banner-disc text-anim">And since I started my journey in Scrum, I've never looked back because I've had no reason to regret.</p>
