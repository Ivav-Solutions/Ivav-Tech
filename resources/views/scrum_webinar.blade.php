        <p>And if youâ€™re just hearing about Scrum, in simple terms, Scrum is a lucrative tech area of interest that helps teams and organizations produce maximum value while working on different projects.</p>
        <p>Hello, I'm Oluwaseun</p>
        <p>In 2015, I graduated with a degree in Geography but the first job opportunity I had after NYSC was in Digital Marketing.</p>
        <p>To cut the long story short, I only practiced as a Digital Marketing professional until around mid- 2022 when I joined my current company as a Marketing Manager and through this new job opportunity, my aspirations of working alongside highly technical teams started becoming a reality.</p>
        <p>Is Digital Marketing not full of opportunities?</p>
        <p>Of course, it is! I knew Digital Marketing is very lucrative but Scrum and Product Ownership have risen to become the new 'oil' and experts in these areas are highly sought after.</p>
        <p>But I had one problem...</p>
        <p>I wasn't interested in coding. While I believe knowing the basics is not out of place, I knew it wasn't a thing I would love to do in the long term.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, I met my mentor in this company and he introduced me to this profitable IT field (Scrum) I never knew existed.</p>
        <p>For me, the distinctive approach of Scrum to actualizing both IT-related and non IT-related projects caught my attention.</p>
        <p>Not only that, with many limitations that come with planning, executing and managing a project, Scrum has proven to be the most appropriate project management framework adopted by more than 70% tech startups and top IT firms in the world.</p>
        <p>So, why wouldn't I embrace this rare privilege?</p>
        <p>And since I started my journey in Scrum, I've never looked back because I've had no reason to regret.</p>
        <h2 style="padding-top: 1.5rem;">Now Your Turn</h2>
        <p>I know you've read a lot and watched several videos about how to get started but I'm a living proof that you can start your journey in Scrum without any tech related experience and my mentor also wants to show you in practical, how you can do that.</p>
        <p>That's why he has organized a free webinar where he will reveal to you exactly how to transition smoothly into Scrum or Product Ownership (which some also call Product Management).</p>
        <p>In this free webinar you will discover:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>1. How to become a qualified Scrum Master or Product Owner, even without a tech experience.</p></li>
            <li><p>2. How he landed his first job offer and how you can earn your first Scrum master position.</p></li>
            <li><p>3. What your CV should look like to make notable international companies develop interest in working with you, even as a newbie.</p></li>
            <li><p>4. What the exact duties of a Scrum Master and a Product Owner.</p></li>
            <li><p>5. The distinction between a Scrum Master and a Project Manager.</p></li>
            <li><p>6. How much a beginner Scrum Master or Product Owner can make.</p></li>
            <li><p>7. What varieties of job opportunities are available to Scrum Masters and Product Owners.</p></li>
            <li><p>8. What certifications are available and which is the best.</p></li>
        </ul>
