                    <h2>Scrum Master Certification</h2>
                    <p>Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.</p>
                    <p>
                        As a scrum master, you will coordinate a project, guide a result-oriented team together with the product owner, and ensure the team members follow agile best practices. 

                        This interactive and activity-based training will equip you with the comprehensive understanding of professional scrum and what a scrum master's responsibilities are.

                        At the end of this training, you will be certified to lead agile-minded teams and achieve the goals of different projects you undertake.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the scrum Iâ€™m talking about is most frequently used by software development teams, its principles and lessons can be applied to all kinds of teamwork. This is one of the reasons scrum is so popular. Often thought of as an agile project management framework, 
                        scrum describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.
                    </p>
